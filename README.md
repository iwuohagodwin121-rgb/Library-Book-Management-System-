# Library-Book-Management-System-

The Library Book Management System is a simple console-based Python application designed to help manage books in a library. The system allows users to add new books with their titles and authors, view a list of all books, and exit the program when finished.

This project demonstrates the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in practice, including planning, requirements analysis, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It is intended to provide a hands-on understanding of how a software project is developed, implemented, and maintained using Python.

Key features:

Add books with title and author information

View all added books in an organized list

Easy-to-use menu-driven interface

The system is lightweight, easy to run, and works on any computer with Python installed.
